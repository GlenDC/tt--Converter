tt--Converter
=============

A program that converts FBX files to tt::Engine files.

Extracts mesh and skeleton data from a batch of fbx files and generates binary files that can be read by tt::Engine.

Required: PhysX SDK and FBX SDK

Build settings for Debug and Release should be just fine, just do a full rebuild and run the frontend.
